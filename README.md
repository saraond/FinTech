FinTech: MVP Implementation

# Purpose
In this assignment, we build on the business plan we conducted previously and implements the technology from the business plan with the means of coding. The code represents a Minimum Viable Product and gives direction regarding the feature functionality.

# About the project
We are implementing an MVP for our Investment Portfolio Manager. The goal is to provide a trading platform that makes investing easier to understand for the wider audience by providing calculated recommendations, connecting users with investors of various experience levels and making various education resources on trading available.

# Good to know beforehand
For most part, the code can be ran as it is. The API key used to retrieve real time data from stock markets is from a throwaway account and can be thus used freely. As for the trade execution part, I could not retrieve a functional set of API keys and the code thus stays for demonstration purposes only and running it will not give any results. This is clearly stated before the code.
